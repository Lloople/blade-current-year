## TREEWARE

You're free to use this package, but if it makes it to your production environment I would highly appreciate you buying the world a tree.

It’s now common knowledge that one of the best tools to tackle the climate crisis and keep our temperatures from rising above 1.5C is to plant trees. If you contribute to my forest you’ll be creating employment for local families and restoring wildlife habitats.
